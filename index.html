I am an avid outdoor person and often like to spot for little flowers, plants and leaves as I made my hiking trials along the way. I admire the flowers.
I like to make short trails around Singapore, from Changi Coastal, Mount Faber, Sentosa, Central reserviors to Jurong Lake.
Recently I also started plogging, it combines many focused lunges and squats. It helps to boost my endurance  and improving my fitness.
Text me if you would like to join me for a short session.
